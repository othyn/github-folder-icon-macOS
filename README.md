# GitHub Folder Icon for macOS
Made so that it fits nicely alongside all the others inside your home directory... or wherever.

## Todo
- Small icon had more defined edges / dropshadow, need to figure out how to extract that icon and look at the styling instead of using the same image for all sizes

## How to source the folder icon
1. Create a new folder (or use an existing one)
2. Right click on the folder and select "Get Info"
3. Select the image next to the name of the folder (icon in the top left of the window) and copy it (via âŒ˜ + C or Edit -> Copy)
4. While that is in your clipboard, pop open Photoshop (PS) (or editor of choice) and create a new project from the clipboard
5. Edit as necessary!

## Editing notes
In the included PSD, I've ruled out the centre points / thing's I think will be handy. The layout for which I sketched out from other macOS icons, using the above method to first get the icon (say, Downloads) into PS, then looking at the dimensions / layout / opacity / colour / inner-dropshadow used within that to make it as similar as possible. Just took a hell of a lot of fiddling with the blending options, making micro adjustments, while comparing it to the reference icon until it looked as near as I could realistically get it.
